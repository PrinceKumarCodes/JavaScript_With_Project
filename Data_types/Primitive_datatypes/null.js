// null primitive data type
// null is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is used to signify that a variable, object, or property does not have a value.
// Unlike undefined, which typically means a variable has been declared but not initialized, null is explicitly assigned to indicate that there is no value present.// null primitive data type.
let value = null;
console.log(value); //null
console.log(typeof range); //object
