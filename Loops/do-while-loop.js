// The 'do-while' loop in JavaScript is similar to the 'while' loop but, with one key difference : the condition is checked after the loop body executes. Due to this property if we use 'do-while' loop, the code inside the loop will execute at least once,

let value = 1;
do {
  value++;
  console.log(value);
} while (value <= 10);
